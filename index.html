		In 2017, the ministry recruited around <strong>300 volunteers</strong> who agreed, in exchange for a ‚Ç¨25 Amazon voucher 
		ü§ë, 
		to have their names and two biometric photos stored in a database and to carry a transponder around with them. 
		This allowed authorities to know at what day and time they crossed through the station.
		<br/>
		On August that year, the project, known as <strong>‚ÄúSafety Station S√ºdkreuz‚Äù</strong>, took off. <br/>
