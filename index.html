			In 2017, the ministry recruited around <strong>300 volunteers</strong> who agreed, in exchange for a ‚Ç¨25
			Amazon voucher
			ü§ë,
			to have their names and two biometric photos stored in a database and to carry a transponder around with
			them.
			This allowed authorities to know at what day and time they crossed through the station.
			<br /><br />
			On August that year, the project, known as <strong>‚ÄúSafety Station S√ºdkreuz‚Äù</strong>, took off. <br /><br />
